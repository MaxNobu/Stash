                Kevin Lee Do, AKA Nobu, started his pursuit in the field of I.T (Information Technology) attending Mid-State Technical College in early 2024 aiming to build relationships with business owners and clients across the nation by providing the skills necessary for web design and software development. Nobu also seeks to introduce a wide range of freelance services within his business, Nobu Tech that offers repairs on computer hardware, mobile phones, gaming consoles, engineering, and automotive technology innovations.
                <br>
                <br>
                In the long term he eventually wishes to pursue a healthy career as a game developer that will compete with today’s popular MMORRPG, action and adventure, to even indie titles such as Final Fantasy XIV, Black Desert, Fallout, Cyberpunk 2077, and Stray: all honorable mentions in which Nobu has gained heavy inspiration from over the years.
                <br>
                <br>
                Outside of Nobu’s professional life, he enjoys activities such as racing, music, art, gaming, and keeping active with routine jogs and playing tennis.
